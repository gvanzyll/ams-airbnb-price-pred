# Amsterdam Airbnb Price Predictor 

Amsterdam is a city near and dear to my heart. The people are great, it’s easy to get around, and the food is lekker (Dutch for “tasty”). Amsterdam is well-known for its culture, art, canals, and architecture. It’s a melting pot of Dutch and international culture alike. Unsurprisingly, Amsterdam is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world, which, equally unsurprisingly, makes it a fairly expensive place to visit.

I’ve been fortunate enough to visit Amsterdam on many occasions and have experienced just about every type of possible accommodation– hotels, hostels, friend’s apartments, family’s houses, and Airbnbs. Deciding where to stay and how much to spend (if applicable) can make or break one’s trip to Amsterdam.

I found an interesting dataset containing information about Airbnbs listings in Amsterdam with 111 columns and over 20,000 listings. I decided to try my hand at predicting Airbnb prices in Amsterdam and investigating which aspects tend to make an Airbnb listing more or less expensive.
